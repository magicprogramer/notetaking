# Django Notetaking App

This project serves as a Django framework practice exercise, focusing on building a notetaking app reminiscent of Obsidian.

## Demo

Explore the current state of the project [here](https://ahmedezzat.pythonanywhere.com/). Please note that the website is under active development and may not be stable. Feel free to clone the repository, modify, and deploy it on your local machine.

## Future Enhancements

Future plans for this project include:

- Adding a graph view for notes
- Incorporating a section for detailed explanations of encountered technologies during development, such as Bootstrap, SMTP services, Django-Quill, and more.

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute!

**Note:** After cloning the repository, you will need to create an account on [Brevo](https://app.brevo.com/), a SMTP service provider. Then, create an API key and use it, along with other configurations to set up the SMTP server in the `notetaking/noteTaking/noteTaking/settings.py` file which we will use to send verfication emails.
